      <h2>We wanted a better mattress and a better buying experience</h2>
      <p>Loom & Leaf was born out of the success of our innerspring mattress, Saatva. Saatva was a place where we discovered people like ourselves -- people who did not think it was too much to ask to get the best nights' sleep on a luxury mattress without the cost, drama, and hassle of mattress shopping in stores.</p>

  <!-- OUR STORY -->
  <div class="ourstory">

      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>Over the last several years, we have watched our innerspring mattress company, Saatva, grow from a mid-sized regional luxury mattress company to one of the largest online-only mattress companies in America, as more and more customers (like us) want a great product for a great price without the hassle. It’s a simple idea that has really caught on.</p>
        <p>We combine the best known luxury and eco-friendly materials and technologies in a mattress, we make it in America, and we sell it online so that customers don’t have to pay outrageous mark-up costs to get a decent nights’ sleep.</p>
        <p>The Loom & Leaf mattress has been a natural extension of our success. We wanted to extend our product line so that customers looking for a memory foam mattress could have the benefit of a better product and better buying experience. Utilizing the infrastructure we established with Saatva, we now have 11 factories throughout America fabricating our L&L mattresses, and over 32 fulfillment centers that deliver our mattresses coast to coast. The results of our model have been fantastic, and it shows in our customer reviews.</p>
        <p>We never forget that our company and our successes are built on individual consumer satisfaction and recommendations. It is this attitude that has helped us become the best reviewed mattress brand on Google in 2013-2015, and we will continue to serve our new and repeat customers each day going forward.</p>

            <h3>Giving back is in our DNA</h3>
            <p>We are not only committed to giving customers a better nights’ sleep and a better buying experience, we are equally passionate about our planet and our communities. For us, it’s not enough to be good at what you do. The real proof of character is in giving back to those in need. In the last year we have donated hundreds of mattresses and partnered with over 10 organizations.</p>
            <p>Recently, we partnered with the Seeds of Hope organization to provide 50 free mattresses to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy along the Jersey Shore. As many of you know, the shorelines and communities along New Jersey and New York were destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, leaving many families without a home or a place to sleep. As many families struggled to rebuild, we wanted to make sure they didn’t have the added stress and expense of trying to buy a decent mattress in addition to everything else. It was the least we could do.</p>
            <p class="quote">“The devastation at the shore is beyond words and the initiative that you and your company took to supplymattresses to those in need is also beyond words.”</p>
            <p>John P. Volz, Director / Seeds of Hope Ministries</p>
            <p>As we continue to grow, we will always continue to seek ways to help struggling communities in any way we can.</p>
