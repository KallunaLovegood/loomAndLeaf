      <h2>We wanted a better mattress and a better buying experience</h2>
      <p>Loom & Leaf was born out of the success of our innerspring mattress, Saatva. Saatva was a place where we discovered people like ourselves -- people who did not think it was too much to ask to get the best nights' sleep on a luxury mattress without the cost, drama, and hassle of mattress shopping in stores.</p>

  <!-- OUR STORY -->
  <div class="ourstory">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left">
        <div class="photo one"></div>
        <div class="photo two"></div>
        <div class="photo three"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="right">
        <p>We are based out of Westport CT and Austin TX. Within the last few years, we have grown from a mid-sized regional company to the largest luxury mattress brand operating exclusively online in the United States, with 12 manufacturing partners and 35 fulfillment centers throughout the country.</p>
        <p>We did the hard work to get here, but we know our success was built on individual customer satisfaction and feedback. Our philosophy was and is simple: combine good old fashioned customer service with a modern e-commerce platform. This has kept our online business model nimble, allowing us numerous advantages over the brick and mortar shops burdened with expensive rent, excessive maintenance, utility costs and commissions. The money we save directly affects the price you pay.</p>
        <p>Today, we are so proud of our ‘ultra’ luxury memory foam bed, Loom and Leaf. This is a special memory foam bed, a masterpiece; it’s not your average block of foam. We wanted to solve common memory foam issues like excessive heat, the unappealing look and very unreasonable price. We carried over perfected principles from our successful innerspring line: the use of bio-based foams, plant based natural thistle flame retardant and luxurious organic cotton. We designed five comprehensive layers to combine the benefits of our contouring memory foam, patented medical-grade cooling gel and multi-layered quilt surface to form a truly ultra luxury experience that cools and conforms uniquely to you.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to set a new standard of transparency. Objectively measured, Loom & Leaf compares best to premium brand mattresses that sell in stores for well over $3,000, except ours is half that. We will do everything possible to ensure a positive experience for the customer, before, during and after purchase. We work hard to protect our image and we hope you realize the benefits of dealing with a company that is its own proprietary brand.</p>
        <p>I personally strive to treat everyone fairly and respectfully. My manufacturing partners all have a minimum of 25 years experience in building quality mattresses and I treat them like I treat my customers, a practice you will seldom find in the mattress business. Great relationships make for good business!</p>
        <p>I truly hope we see you as a customer soon. If you like the feel of a memory foam bed and shied away because of their reputation for extra heat, or if you are just interested in a first time experience — then you will love our luxurious Loom and Leaf!</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Ron Rudzin, CEO</p>

            <h3>Giving back is in our DNA</h3>
            <p>We are not only committed to giving customers a better nights’ sleep and a better buying experience, we are equally passionate about our planet and our communities. For us, it’s not enough to be good at what you do. The real proof of character is in giving back to those in need. In the last year we have donated hundreds of mattresses and partnered with over 10 organizations.</p>
            <p>Recently, we partnered with the Seeds of Hope organization to provide 50 free mattresses to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy along the Jersey Shore. As many of you know, the shorelines and communities along New Jersey and New York were destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, leaving many families without a home or a place to sleep. As many families struggled to rebuild, we wanted to make sure they didn’t have the added stress and expense of trying to buy a decent mattress in addition to everything else. It was the least we could do.</p>
            <p class="quote">“The devastation at the shore is beyond words and the initiative that you and your company took to supplymattresses to those in need is also beyond words.”</p>
            <p>John P. Volz, Director / Seeds of Hope Ministries</p>
            <p>As we continue to grow, we will always continue to seek ways to help struggling communities in any way we can.</p>
