                    <h3>Blessed Relief!</h3>
                    <p>Prior to purchasing a king size Luxury Firm Saatva mattress and foundation we owned a year old top-of-the-line (and costly) memory foam system. I have severe spinal stenosis in the lumbar and sacral regions of my back, to the point that I could only walk with a walker. My pain level was increasing dramatically the longer I slept on the memory foam bed. We received our Saatva bed earlier this week, and after only two nights sleeping on the Saatva bed my pain level has been reduced by at least 90%. After the second night I was able to retire my walker to a closet, and walk normally for the first time in several years. I would recommend Saatva to anyone who has a back problem, and if I could rate the Saatva 10 stars out of 10, I would! Thank you for producing such a high quality product and at a surprisingly reasonable price!!!</p>

                    <h3>Twice Disappointed after 6 months</h3>
                    <p>I purchased a Saatva mattress in February after my 8 year old mattress was sagging too much. I really like a firm mattresses and my wife agreed to the extra firm if my complaining would stop. I talked with the associates and they agreed it would be a good fit with my sleeping descriptions. We are in the extended delivery area so our delivery took 10-14 day and extra cost - very acceptable. The mattress was extremely firm out of the box. We had the mattress approximately a week or so and my wife hated it and had to see a chiropractor because her neck hurt so bad - she began sleeping in our guest bed room. I called the Saatva about getting a change. They suggested a topper to put on top. This probably would have been ok, but the mattress is already 14" and 4 more seemed too high and finding sheets would be impossible. We settled on getting a new Luxury Firm. KEY NOTE, I didn't know that I would be charged a new $300 delivery fee. That hurt. The new mattress comes and the wife loves it, all is well. Now it is six months later, we've rotated the bed as suggested, but divets have developed and you have to sleep in one position. When you sleep on your side, your legs are higher and you get a twisting motion. 7 hours is about all we can take before have to get out of bed. I'm about 190 and my wife is 125. We just didn't expect after $1600 we would have this issue. I'm eating alot of crow for trying the online thing and we'll be shopping for a new mattress soon. Again very disappointed. </p>

                    <h3>Perfect in every way</h3>
                    <p>My experience began with a conversation with one of the Saatva owners. I needed a large quantity of mattresses in a short period of time - before Thanksgiving. They also had to be shipped across the country. I was assured they would put forth the extra effort to make that happen. The mattresses arrived the week before Thanksgiving and we were thrilled. Somehow I knew, after my conversation, that Saatva would keep their promise to deliver on time. Our fourteen family members then had the delightful pleasure of sleeping on these wonderful mattresses. Every single person absolutely LOVED their experience. I have included a few of their comments: "I don't think I've ever slept on a better mattress. My back pain was reduced after only two nights. It was fantastic." "I didn't wake up once! I loved going to sleep and waking up in such an awesome bed!" "Thank you for the amazingly comfortable mattress!" "It was a heavenly bed and experience." "Sleeping on that mattress was like sleeping on a cloud, and I never wanted to leave! Thank you so much!" "We loved the mattress - our pillowtop at home is too cushy and this mattress was the perfect blend of plush and firm, and made in the USA! Hooray!" "We loved the mattress. It was very comfortable. It has just the right combination of softness and firmness. Thank you for putting them together so quickly." It is truly amazing to have such a great experience from beginning to end in this day and age. I am so happy I found this company and will definitely refer people to them and use them again for any future needs.</p>

                    <h3>Great Product!</h3>
                    <p>Like many others, I hesitated to order a mattress on the internet. However, I have to say I am very pleased with the quality of the product and the very good customer service. I ordered the Luxury Firm, and it is indeed "just right", not too hard and not too soft. A very good buying experience, and the price is an incredible value.</p>
